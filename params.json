  "body": "This is a tutorial for the Haskell web framework Fn. It's designed to give\r\nweb developers an idea of how Haskell web development works. It won't\r\nteach you *everything* you need to know, but I hope it'll give you a place to\r\nstart and an idea of just how fun it is!\r\n\r\nTo get started, you need to know [how to use git](git@github.com:emhoracek/fntutorial.git)\r\nand some [command line basics](git@github.com:emhoracek/fntutorial.git).\r\n\r\nYou also want to know a little Haskell:\r\n\r\n  * What are types and functions in Haskell?\r\n  * How do you define a data type?\r\n  * How do you make a data type an instance of a type class?\r\n  * What the Maybe type?\r\n  * How do you do stuff \"in IO\"?\r\n\r\n[Learn you a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) is one way to learn these basics,\r\nand it's free online! You can also try the [Haskell wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell).\r\n\r\nWhen you're ready to get started, clone this repository:\r\n\r\n`git clone https://github.com/emhoracek/fntutorial.git`\r\n\r\nYou'll also need to install Stack, which installs the Haskell compiler and all the\r\nlibraries and modules you'll need. Just follow the directions for your operating\r\nsystem [here](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README.html).\r\n\r\nMake sure \"~/.local/bin\" is in your $PATH, so your OS can find everything\r\nStack installs.\r\n\r\nThen change to the `fntutorial` directory, and run `stack build`. This will download and install everything! It will take a very long time if you haven't used Stack before.\r\n\r\n(If you have any problems building, let me know so I can help!)\r\n\r\nOnce the build is finished, run `stack exec site1` and visit [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to see a \"Hello world\" Haskell site running on your machine! Type CTRL-C to quit the server when you're done.\r\n\r\nEach site's source code contains a part of the tutorial. Read each \"*.lhs\" file's source to learn how to make Haskell sites with Fn, WAI, and Warp!\r\n\r\n* \"Site1.lhs\" - `stack exec site1` -- a \"Hello world!\" site\r\n* \"Site2.lhs\" - `stack exec site2` -- how do routes and handlers work?\r\n* \"Site3.lhs\" - `stack exec site3` -- adding HTML with Lucid\r\n* \"Site4.lhs\" - `stack exec site4` --- serving static files\r\n*  ...more to come!\r\n\r\n(I will add more resources for how to learn more here.)\r\n",
